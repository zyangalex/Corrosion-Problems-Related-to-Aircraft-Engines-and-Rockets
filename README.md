# Corrosion-Problems-Related-to-Aircraft-Engines-and-Rockets
Since the Wright brothers invented the airplane, the aircraft and aerospace industry has become one of the most important tools used by humans to explore the world and space. However, building an aircraft or a rocket is very expensive, so the prevention of corrosion for aircraft and rocket components is essential. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the issue of corrosion and its prevention for aircraft engines and rockets due to the high-temperature oxidation and mixed gases environment. High temperature corrosion can be divided into high temperature oxidation, hot corrosion, carbonization, and sulfidation. High temperature oxidation is mainly the reaction of oxygen and metals at high temperatures to form oxides. Also, exposure to molten salts accelerates corrosion by degrading protective oxides and causing the mechanical properties of the material to deteriorate. The major concept of treatments like coating, increasing rate of diffusion of alloying elements, and thermal protection is creating oxide layers which prevent environmental attack and corrosion of the material.
